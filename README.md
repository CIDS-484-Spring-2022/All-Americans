# All-American's
# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to find out what high school track and field athletes have the potential to become All-American's at the Division Three level in college. To find out what high school athletes have this potential you first must find the current and past All-American's high school times/marks. This kind of data is hard to find and requires me to build a dataset of my own to find these times/marks. I am using TFRSS to find who were All-American's and what their college personal bests were for the given event. Athletic.net is the website that is being used to find the high school times of the All-Americans.
# Software
It will be coded in R to help do statistical analyze as well with helping visual the data.
# Current Progress
Currently I have finished the All-American project as I have completed all the coding for the analysis of the three datasets (Decathlon, Heptathlon, All-American). I have also finished the paper breaking down all the things I did and analyzed, showing and explaining what the data says, as well as explaining all the steps I took throughout the project. The code is put into Rmarkdown, which helps break down the code step by step while also explaining the code and its results.
