# All-Americans
# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to find out what high school track and field athletes have the potential to become All-Americans at the Division Three level in college. To find out what high school athletes have this potential you first must find the current and past All-Americans' high school times/marks. This kind of data is hard to find and requires me to build a dataset of my own to find these times/marks. I am using TFRSS to find who were All-Americans and what their college personal bests were for the given event. Athletic.net is the website that is being used to find the high school times of the All-Americans.
# Software
It will be coded in R to help do statistical analyze as well with helping visual the data.
# Current Progress
Currently I am two to three years left to find data on the All-Americans, I have finished 2021, 2019, 2018, and currently on 2017. I will also have 2016, 2015, and the heptathlon/decathlon to complete. Watch the video below to learn more about the progress of the data set or to see the file of the data, look for it above. Currently there is no code, as the data set is not yet completed or organized to be used in R.
