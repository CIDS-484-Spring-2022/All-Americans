# All-Americans
# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to find out what high school track and field athletes have the potential to become All-Americans at the Division Three level in college. To find out what high school athletes have this potential you first must find the current and past All-Americans' high school times/marks. This kind of data is hard to find and requires me to build a dataset of my own to find these times/marks. I am using TFRSS to find who were All-Americans and what their college personal bests were for the given event. Athletic.net is the website that is being used to find the high school times of the All-Americans.
# Software
It will be coded in R to help do statistical analyze as well with helping visual the data.
# Current Progress
Currently I have finished collecting the data for the three datasets, All-American, Decathlon, and Heptathlon, and formatted correctly in be used in R. I have started coding with these datasets and looked into the states all of the All-Americans are from. I was looking into analyzing the high school times by event before I stopped to finish the rough draft for the paper.
